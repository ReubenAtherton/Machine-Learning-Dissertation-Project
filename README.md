# Machine-Learning-Dissertation-Project

My final year dissertation paper focussing on the developing Tsetlin Machine and the importance algorithm interpretability within ML models.

I developed each of the scripts included above, using the pre-built Tsetlin Machine to train and test the NoisyXOR dataset.
