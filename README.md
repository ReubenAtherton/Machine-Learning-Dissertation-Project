Abstract.

This paper discusses the value of machine learning visualisation, more specifically visualisation of the Tsetlin Machine. The motivation for such work includes how interpretability and visualisation of algorithms can be used to justify predictions made by machine learning models in high stake environments. Other motivations include the benefits of visualisation when studying new algorithms, as well as using visual tools to provide insight into the internal dynamics of the model, allowing for performance improvements to be made. The work associated with this paper uses visual driven experiments to:

  a) demonstrate how class voting is implemented – this concept can be scaled up and used to help when learning different concepts within the TM.
  
  b) plot the average number of TA state flips where a thesis was drawn such that the average rate of change of number of TA flips is inversely proportional to the learning rate ‘s’ hyper-parameter. This thesis would not have been made without the visual aid of graphs plotted, further solidifying the benefits of such tools.
  
  c) finally, propose a novel idea involving locally stochastic clause dropping where methods of data extraction for said idea are shown. Again, visualisation was implemented in order to get such results.

I developed each of the scripts included above, using the pre-built Tsetlin Machine to train and test the NoisyXOR dataset.
